# Portfolio
By Usman Murtala

# The Story
I had a portfolio i thought was awesome built entirely on bootstrap, but then reality
sets in when i saw awesome portfolios people were creating, suddenly my seemingly awesome
portfolio wasn't so awesome anymore. Incidentally i was learning vue.js and vuetify when
i decided to code up another portfolio. So after learning the vuetify framework, i coded up
this portfolio. It might not be my best work but it is my best portfolio as the time of writing
this readme.
